# Final Project Data Analyst 

This project was done as the final project for the Udacity Course "Introduction to Programming". The topic was an analysis of no-show doctor appointments. The researched dataset has information from more than 100 000 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

Summary: This research project found no indicators of any positive or negative correlation between alcoholism and no-show rate at medical appointments. This finding is tentative, further analysis should be conducted to see if other variables of the dataset have a correlation.
